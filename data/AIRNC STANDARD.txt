The first field in each record is the record identifier, which specifies the type of data contained in the record. In this case, the record identifier is "SUSAP", which stands for "Supplementary Airport" and indicates that the record contains information about an airport or other location.

The second field is the location identifier, which is a combination of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies the location. In this case, the location identifier appears to consist of the airport identifier "KABE" followed by a route designator "K6", which may indicate that the location is a waypoint on a route with the designator "K6".
